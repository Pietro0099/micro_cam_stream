# Micro cam stream

Welcome to micro_cam_stream


This script was built to run RGB image stream + predictions + latency data(optional) from microcontroller to Desktop.
This script requires a YAML settings file to run (see -> "doc.md").


YAML settings file:
- You must build a YAML file inside the same folder where this script is located, containing all the needed variables.
- If the script crashes, it will try to find and give you the related error. Please ensure you have built the file correctly in case you get an error.
- All the variables needed are documented in -> "doc.md".
